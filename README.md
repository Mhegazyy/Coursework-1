# Coursework-1
To run the program, the user must run the “driver.py” file once. This will create two .txt files with the names “Message.txt” and “Key.txt”. The user must then enter the message he/she wants to encrypt into the “Message.txt” file and then run the “driver.py” code once again. If the user does not input a message into the “Message.txt” file and tries to run the “driver.py” file, the file will output an error that asks the user to write a message in the “Message.txt”. Once the user enters a message and runs the program, the program will create two files and store the output inside them under the names “Encrypted.txt” and “Decrypted.txt” respectively. The program accepts all characters including upper and lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, new lines, and spaces.
